# SubaruScraper

The original idea was to build an application that monitors mobile.bg for new listings.

This project is used for learning purposes and is split in two variants:
  1) Desktop application that stores the listings in an SQLite db and sends email notification via Gmail
  2) Web appliaction using Flask. Have not decided on a online database yet. 
  
The project covers:
- Web Scraping;
- Databases;
- Flask frame;
- API calls;
- Server hosting.
